# Image Setup Instructions

## Background Image for Landing Page

To complete the setup, please save the world map image from the TJB Enterprise PDF to:

**Location:** `c:\Hi-tech-enterprises\assets\images\world-map-bg.jpg`

### Steps:
1. Open the PDF file "TJB ENTERPRISE (1).pdf"
2. Extract the world map image (the one showing "1000+ Machine Dispatch In Domestic Market")
3. Save it as `world-map-bg.jpg` in the `assets\images` folder
4. The image should show:
   - TJB Enterprise branding
   - World map with country markers
   - "1000+ Machine Dispatch" text
   - India map detail

### Alternative:
If you have the image in a different format, you can:
- Convert it to JPG or PNG
- Name it `world-map-bg.jpg` or `world-map-bg.png`
- Update the CSS file (line ~241) to match the extension if using PNG

The hero section is already configured to use this image as a full-screen background with a semi-transparent overlay and white text on top.
